# Air Quality Indexes of New York Regions  

## Overview  
This repository contains a dataset of air quality indexes (AQI) for various pollutants measured across different regions in New York. It provides valuable insights into spatial and temporal pollution trends, which can be used for research, urban planning, and health impact analysis.  

## Dataset Features  
- **Timeframe:** Contains data collected over a specific period (e.g., daily, monthly, or yearly).  
- **Regions Covered:** Various urban, suburban, and rural regions within New York.  
- **Pollutants Monitored:**  
  - Particulate Matter (PM2.5 and PM10)  
  - Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2)  
  - Sulfur Dioxide (SO2)  
  - Carbon Monoxide (CO)  
  - Ozone (O3)  
- **Air Quality Index (AQI):** Includes AQI values and their corresponding categories.  

## Dataset Columns  
| Column Name       | Description                                              |  
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|  
| `Date/Time`       | Timestamp of data collection.                            |  
| `Region Name`     | Specific region in New York where data was collected.    |  
| `Pollutant Name`  | Type of pollutant (e.g., PM2.5, O3).                     |  
| `Concentration`   | Measured pollutant concentration (µg/m³ or ppm).         |  
| `AQI Value`       | Computed AQI value for the pollutant.                    |  

## Use Cases  
- **Environmental Analysis:** Analyze air quality patterns across different regions and times.  
- **Machine Learning:** Build models to predict AQI levels or identify pollution hotspots.  
- **Policy and Planning:** Inform policymakers for air quality management strategies.  
- **Health Research:** Study correlations between air quality and public health metrics.
